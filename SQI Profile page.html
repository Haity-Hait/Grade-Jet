                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>SQI College of ICT offers both National Innovation Diploma and Professional Certificate programmes.
    
                    The diploma Certificate conforms with the standard National Diploma Certificate obtained in Polytechnics while the Professional certificate is the certificate you earn after taking a professional course here at SQI.
                    
                    You can use the Diploma certificate to seek admissions into the University through Direct Entry or for Higher National Diploma (HND).

                    <p>I've compared other platforms to this one to be honest and they don't measure up. The platforms that give a comparable level of the quality of skills cost a lot more and don't even offer a guarantee of access to real world project and situations... The ones available at a cheaper price so to say do not give a level of quality even close to it... Some platforms charge a lot more and yet still falter in the delivery of good contents... Another aspect that I noticed in comparison is that instructors at SQI College of ICT are actually interested in ensuring their students understand what they are learning. They take joy in ensuring the students comprehend and are able to apply what is being taught and explain in the simplest ways possible to ensure maximum comprehension....I'm not sharing this because I have any affiliation with SQI College of ICT, I'm doing so because it's simply the truth. If anyone else tries to make their research, they will find out that it's true too.</p>
